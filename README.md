NeuralFit is a simple neuro-evolution library for Python with an API that is similar to the [Keras](https://keras.io/) library. You can train models with evolution instead of backpropagation in just a few lines of codes. You can also export evolved models to Keras so you can use them in your existing environments without changing a thing. For more information, please visit https://neuralfit.net/. <b>üêõ NeuralFit is currently in the alpha phase and being developed rapidly, expect many bugs and crashes.</b>

## Installation
You can install NeuralFit via `pip>=19.3`. Note that currently only Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 are supported with the latest version of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) installed. Furthermore, NeuralFit can only be installed on `x86_64` machines running on Windows or Linux (although not all Linux distributions are supported). 

```
pip install neuralfit
```

## Get started
As an example, you can evolve a model to learn the [XOR gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate) as follows.

```python
import neuralfit as nf
import numpy as np

# Define dataset
x = np.asarray([[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]])
y = np.asarray([[0], [1], [1], [0]])

# Define model (2 inputs, 1 output)
model = nf.Model(2, 1)

# Compile and evolve
model.compile('alpha', loss='mse', monitors=['size'])
model.evolve(x,y)
```

To verify that your model has fitted the dataset correctly, we can check its predictions. 

```python
print(model.predict(x))
```

Done with evolving your model? Simply save the model or export it to Keras!

```python
# Save model
model.save('model.nf')

# Export model to Keras
keras_model = model.to_keras()
```

There is much more to discover about NeuralFit, and new features are being added rapidly. Please visit the official [documentation](https://neuralfit.net/documentation/) for more information or follow one of our [examples](https://neuralfit.net/examples/).
